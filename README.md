# hello-world
Learning to use GitHub

Hello Computer Geeks! I'm a med student aspiring to join your ranks to do biomedical research! Excited to be a part of this journey!

I cloned hello-world to my computer! I will now try to push it back to my remote repo on github.

I am now adding new text to readme while on the branch called "newbranch"

I'm adding text on my remote repo and will try to push back to the local repo.
